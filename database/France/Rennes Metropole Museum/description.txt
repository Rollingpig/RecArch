The Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes (MusÃ©e des beaux-arts de Rennes) is a municipal museum of fine arts in the French city of Rennes, the capital of Brittany.
Its collections range from ancient Egypt antiquities to the Modern art period and make the museum one of the most important in France outside Paris, notably for its paintings and drawings holdings. The collection includes paintings created between the 14th and 20th centuries.


The project is the result of a competition held in 2006 for an Eco Museum, and it includes exhibition spaces, reception and administrative offices, wrapped in a wooden skin.
