A team made up of Barcelona-based firm MX_SI and Mexican practice SPRB Arquitectos has been selected to design the Papalote Children’s Museum in Iztapalapa, Mexico.


Under the slogan “Let’s Make City,” their proposal seeks to integrate the museum with the city and surrounding public space. 


The national competition to design the museum originally received 171 proposals, of which seven were shortlisted. MX_SI + SPRB Arquitectos' design was unanimously selected for first place by the jury.
