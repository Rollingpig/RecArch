        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its integration with the local geological features of the ancient volcano and the use of local materials to reflect the region's natural and historical aspects. It offers a unique blend of practicality and sculptural form, providing a new way for visitors to explore both architecture and nature.",
        "shape": "The external shape of the museum mimics a shield volcano, in line with Nanshan's original topography.",
        "spatial design": "The internal spiral structure allows visitors to move along an annular pathway to view the exhibits, providing a rich spatial experience and indoor-outdoor interaction.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of local materials, such as basalt and green bricks, for the facade decoration, which offers cost savings and reduces maintenance expenses.",

    "exterior": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its organic integration with the landscape, emulating the forms of earth and stone, creating a fluid and natural appearance.",
        "shape": "The form is curvilinear and undulating, with a series of interconnected rounded mounds mirroring the natural topography.",
        "spatial design": "Its shape and form highlight continuity with nature, with smooth transitions and wavy contours that suggest movement and flow.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of materials that echo the surrounding environment, particularly stone or stone-like cladding, contributing to the seamless visual integration with the setting.",

        "highlights": "The integration of the building with the natural landscape, particularly how it blends into the hillside.",
        "shape": "The building has an organic, irregular form that appears to be an extension of the landscape.",
        "spatial design": "The structure's shape and form are notable for their seamless fusion with the surrounding environment, giving the impression that the building emerges from the hill.",
        "material design": "The use of what appears to be natural, rugged materials such as stone or earth-toned materials enables the structure to harmonize with the landscape, with a warm, welcoming light contrasting against the cool backdrop.",

    "floorplan": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its organic and fluid layout, which appears to be optimized for certain functionalities, marked by different colors.",
        "shape": "The form used seems to be curvilinear and organic, avoiding right angles for a more naturalistic layout.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the central, circular hub which acts as a focal point, from which other spaces emanate organically.",
        "material design": "While the image does not provide material details, the highlight in its spatial and material design would be the way materials are selected to complement the fluidity and function of each space.",
