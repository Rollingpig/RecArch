        "highlights": "The design concept of IAG Art Museum transitions from disorder to control and from geometry to infinity, with circular elements as a central theme.",
        "shape": "The form is predominantly characterized by the use of circular elements that symbolize infinite reincarnation.",
        "spatial design": "Circular elements are used to bring geometric order to the chaotic space of the original building, illustrating the concept of infinite reincarnation.",
        "material design": "The materials selected provide a low-key, exquisite, and open basic platform with simple white as the overall tone, featuring fine granular expressions in details such as paving, armrests, and ceilings.",

        "highlights": "The design features an expansive atrium with a large skylight that provides ample natural lighting, giving the space an open and airy feel.",
        "shape": "The design is characterized by broad, sweeping staircases and clean horizontal lines that guide the eye across the various levels of the space.",
        "spatial design": "Its open floor plan and the integration of the staircases within the atrium create a sense of flow and connectivity between the levels.",
        "material design": "The pairing of minimalist materials such as concrete, glass, and white-painted metal creates a sleek, modern aesthetic.",
