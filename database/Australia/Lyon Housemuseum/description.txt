The Lyon Housemuseum is an experimental project which speculates on the conjunction of art and living, challenges conventional notions of public and private and explores new relationships between art and architecture through a new hybridised type – a ‘housemuseum’.

Located in Melbourne Australia the building accommodates the daily living needs of a family of four and the requirements of a public museum housing a major collection of Australian contemporary art. The building is open weekly for public tours and for research visits by academics and students. The Housemuseum also hosts an annual program of concerts, artist and architecture talks and other cultural events.

Two large double height spaces – a ‘white cube’ and ‘black box’ – anchor the two ends of the building and are designed explicitly as museum spaces. Private domestic spaces for the family are defined with enclosed boxlike forms and are located across the two levels of the building.
