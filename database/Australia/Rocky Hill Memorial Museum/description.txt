Rocky Hill Memorial Museum is a unique project due to the location and history of the site and we are honored to be involved. Our concept approach was to complement the existing memorial tower and position the new museum in a location to enhance the public experience. Responding to the brief from Goulburn Mulwaree Council, Crone designed a contemporary new structure to complement the existing museum that once served as the caretaker’s cottage. The interior of the new wing includes 230sqm of flexible and adaptable space to exhibit permanent and traveling collections of war memorabilia plus an area for educational programs.

The Memorial Tower Architect, Mr. E.C. Manfred, 'had designed a tower which, rough and rugged in its beauty, conformed to the surrounding hill whereon it stood, and which reminded them of the sturdy bravery of our illustrious soldiers.' The new Museum continues the tower’s legacy by interpreting the unique physical and material site character, conforming to the hill in a contemporary, yet sympathetic way. The Museum building features a new exhibition space designed to accommodate the expanding collection of locally acquired Australian war artifacts. The contemporary structure complements and strengthens the identity of the adjacent refurbished caretaker’s cottage (Manfred and Sons, 1935) which also serves as Museum space and has its own local significance.
