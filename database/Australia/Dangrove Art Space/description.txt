The brief for DANGROVE demanded a new approach to standard museum art storage to support the requirements of the clientâ€™s nearby gallery. It required art storage to be integrated with curatorial, conservation, research, library, workshop, administration, exhibition and performance spaces and other related functions.

The architecture blends pragmatic storage and technical facilities with a hierarchy of experiences created by special spaces, their inter-relationships and the use of light. A journey through the building is choreographed to enhance viewing opportunities and experiences of the collection as well as the back of house working areas required for the gallery and operations to meet the global demands of the collection. The building is over two levels and approximately10,500m2.
