Our clients are art enthusiasts who, over many years, built up a notable collection of South African Art. Their dream was to build a home in South Africa where they could display their art. Their brief was simple: design a live-in art gallery. First, it was to be an art gallery and, secondly, a homeâ€”the setting for their vision - the quaint town of Riebeek Kasteel. The couple fell in love with the town itself and the thriving local art community, and the ERF location on the village's main road would make it possible for the public to enjoy the collection on occasion.

The design process was a practice of balance. While the space primarily needed to be a gallery, it still had to be a home. We had to ensure there would be enough wall space for the art and enough openings to celebrate the views and allow warm natural light to stream in while considering the preservation of the art.
