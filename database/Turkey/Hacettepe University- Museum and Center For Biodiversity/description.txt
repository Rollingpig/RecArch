Situated at the perimeter of the expanse of Hacettepe University's Beytepe Campus in Ankara, Museum, and Center for Biodiversity building house scientific research facilities and exhibition spaces devoted to scientific materials on the topic of biodiversity. Beytepe Campus is on the main development axis in Ankara, the westward highway to Eski≈üehir, which creates severe pressure of urbanization and land fragmentation.

The campus sits on a system of interconnected valleys and ridges that also extend to neighboring campus lands, with several particular valleys which still have a distinct ecosystem. Several long to mid-term projects are under consideration, aimed at preserving this natural resource within the shifting center of a rapidly developing city of five million people. Museum and Center for Biodiversity are one of the most concrete attempts within this scope; it will be a contribution to landscape preservation as well as a social stimulus for the scientific community.
