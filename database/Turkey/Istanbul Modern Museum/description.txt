With 10,500 square meters of usable space across five levels, the new Istanbul Modern building comprises large exhibition galleries, multifunctional spaces, dedicated zones for education, offices, and spaces for commercial activity.

The building is based on an 8.4 x 8.4-meter grid with steel-brace concrete columns designed to resist significant seismic events. The circular columns and round mechanical funnels form an architectural landscape at ground level. The round shapes of these structural elements soften the transition between light and shadow and create a bright and safe environment by removing the sharp division between light and dark.
