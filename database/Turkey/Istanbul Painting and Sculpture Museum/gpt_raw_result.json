        "highlights": "The building combines a sleek, modern design with a vibrant lighting scheme that adds a dynamic element to the structure. The highlight of this design is the contrasting illuminated vertical elements, which provide a stark visual contrast to the predominantly horizontal designs of the windows.",
        "shape": "The building exhibits a blocky, rectilinear form with a strong, grid-like facade pattern. It is a multi-storied structure with a flat roof.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the uniformity and repetition of the window pattern creating a sense of rhythm. The juxtaposition of light and dark areas at night adds depth to the form.",
        "material design": "The building appears to use a combination of concrete or stone for the structure and a reflective material for the windows. The highlight in its spatial and material design is the incorporation of bold lighting, which may be LEDs or another modern lighting technology, emphasizing certain parts of the building for visual impact.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the innovative and dynamic stacking of cubic volumes that extend outward on various levels, which creates a visually compelling and engaging structure.",
        "shape": "The building utilizes a cuboid form that is repeatedly extruded and stacked in a creative play of architecture.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the cantilevered sections which provide shade and outdoor spaces for the building, enhancing the interaction between the interior and exterior environments.",
        "material design": "The contrast in materials between the light-colored primary structure and the darker cladding of the protruding volumes is a significant feature, adding depth and a modern aesthetic to the design.",
