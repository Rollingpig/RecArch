In 2009 Entrepot Number 5 in the Karaköy Harbor was allocated to Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University for the purpose of transforming it into the Istanbul Painting and Sculpture Museum. Thus was the way cleared for the public use of an area which, although located on an important site in the city center, had almost no social permeability, and for the building of an original, high-quality museum to house thousands of valuable works including important pieces of late Ottoman to modern Turkish painting.

At Emre Arolat Architects, in the initial research phase of the design process, we studied the history of the physical and sociological characteristics of the area. Within this framework, the special place that the entrepot and office blocks standing since the end of the 1950s had formed in visual memory came to the fore, over and above the area’s identity as an industrial and harbor region, which had for centuries distinguished it from other parts of the city. We emphasized the importance of preserving these buildings, whose characteristics in scale and structure were so very prominent. In particular, the horizontal geometry of the entrepot buildings’ reinforced concrete, repeated in line with the plane, was a characteristic most worthy of note, and one of the main goals of our design became to continue it. We planned a three-dimensional grid structure into which the new museum’s galleries would be placed, in great part preserving the reinforced concrete load-bearing system while removing the walls and floors.
