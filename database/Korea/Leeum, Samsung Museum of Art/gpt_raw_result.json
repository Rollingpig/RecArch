        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its bold cantilever structure and the use of clean, minimalist lines.",
        "shape": "The form it uses is geometric, predominantly rectangular with an emphasis on horizontal lines.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the expansive cantilever that creates a covered area beneath and the sense of open yet protected space.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of what appears to be metal cladding, giving it a sleek, industrial look.",

        "highlights": "The design showcases a complex, interconnected layout with various rooms and spaces that seem to be designed for specific functions.",
        "shape": "It uses a combination of angular and rectilinear forms, with an absence of conventional symmetry, suggesting a modern or contemporary approach.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the innovative arrangement of spaces, which allows for an organic flow between areas, despite the geometric angularity.",
        "material design": "While materials are not explicitly depicted in this image, the use of shading and hatching may suggest different textures or differentiations in material or elevation in the spatial design.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the contrast between the massive overhead structure and the minimalist cube that appears to support it.",
        "shape": "The design utilizes geometric shapes, prominently featuring a suspended rectangular volume and a cubic volume below it.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the play on perception and gravity, where the overhead structure seems to defy its weight through its connection to the cuboid.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the juxtaposition of materials with different textures and finishes, conveying a sense of both solidity and openness.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the striking contrast between the bold red-and-white striped column and the surrounding monochromatic tones of the space.",
        "shape": "The form uses geometric simplicity, featuring clean lines and rectangular shapes with a distinctively patterned vertical element.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the way the striped column stands out as a sculptural element against the more subdued backdrop of the walls and ceiling.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the play of textures and colors, juxtaposing the sleek, smooth surfaces with the patterned, reflective glass wall in the background.",
