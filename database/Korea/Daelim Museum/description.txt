Located in the residential neighbourhood of Tongui-dong, near historic Gyeongbokgung Palace, Daelim Museum began its life as Korea’s first photography museum. Today, it holds exhibitions that embrace not only photography but also design and a range of other fields, while continuing to expand its own boundaries. Our vision is to function as a museum where the everyday becomes art. As such, we strive to create exhibitions that suggest new types of lifestyle, allowing the general public to enjoy art within everyday life by casting new light on the value of the objects that surround us.
