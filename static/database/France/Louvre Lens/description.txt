The Louvre-Lens is an art museum located in Lens, France, approximately 200 kilometers north of Paris. It displays objects from the collections of the Musée du Louvre that are lent to the gallery on a medium- or long-term basis. The Louvre-Lens annex is part of an effort to provide access to French cultural institutions for people who live outside of Paris. Though the museum maintains close institutional links with the Louvre, it is primarily funded by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.


Opened in December 2012, the Louvre-Lens museum just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Since its inauguration more than 5 million visitors have come through the doors of the museum, which takes a unique approach to decentralization. The Louvre-Lens presents itself not as an “antenna of the Louvre”, but as a “different Louvre”, better adapted to the region and their different publics. According to its designers, it is the culmination of a reflection on a different way of discovering the Louvre and making the national collections more accessible.
