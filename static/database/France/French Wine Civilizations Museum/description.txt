The French Wine Civilizations Museum is being constructed in Bordeaux, France to embrace and expand wine tourism, and is set to open in 2016. The winning entry, designed by XTU Architects has been chosen for its “architectural audacity”.
The museum is set along the banks of the river Garrone and will be a vertical landmark in an otherwise horizontal skyline. The architects envisioned the identity of the museum as a ‘beacon’ and a ‘guardian angel’ for the port and the city. The swirling curves of the building are intended to evoke images of wine swirling in a decanter. The fluidity of its form has been inspired by the setting. This fluidity is not only limited to the exterior. The exhibition space is circular in form and flows continuously. Here one starts from the Forum and reaches back at the Forum at the end of the exhibition. The color of the exterior is Champagne like, chosen to blend with the river as well as the stone buildings in the city.
