In CPARK, which is located in the Haixu Park in the core city of Changning District, we have designed a "exquisite white paper" for IAG. The texture of the paper is designed to provide a low -key, exquisite, open basic platform for the display in the future space, activities and events. The overall tone of the space is based on simple white, and the dynamic line pursues simple and clear. However, in the subtleties, such as paving, armrests, smallpox and other areas, it can interpret the detailed granular expression that fits the artistic temperament of the IAG pioneer. 

The design concept of IAG Art Museum comes from disorder to control, geometry to infinity. We introduce CIRCLE, the circular element with infinite reincarnation throughout the entire project.
On the one hand, the circular elements use a pure geometric order to frame the chaotic space of the original building. At the same time, the infinite reincarnation represented by the circle symbolizes the reincarnation of IAG’s mission of using this as a new position to continue to speak out for Chinese contemporary art. 
The IAG art cinema line is an innovative comprehensive art platform based on art and global artists, galleries, curators, collectors, and brands as soil development.
