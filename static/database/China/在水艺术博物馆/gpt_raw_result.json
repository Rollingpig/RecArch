        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its minimalist aesthetic, sleek and elongated layout, and the way it harmoniously integrates with the tranquil water landscape, creating a serene reflection in the water.",
        "shape": "The form it uses is a long, horizontal, and low-rise structure with a flat roof and vertical elements that appear to be pillars or support structures.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the emphasis on elongation and rhythm, as created by the repetitive vertical elements that generate a sense of continuity and flow.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of reflective materials for the facade, which allows the building to mirror itself in the water, and the transparency achieved through what seems to be glass or a similar transparent material between the vertical supports.",
