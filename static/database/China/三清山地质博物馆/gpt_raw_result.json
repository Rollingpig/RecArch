        "highlights": "The Sanqingshan Geological Museum is designed to reflect the geological origins and the tectonic movements of the area, integrating its structure with the natural environment and engaging visitors in an experience that emulates geological processes through its spatial layout and material choice.",
        "shape": "The architectural form is characterized by bidirectional compression with longitudinal fissures and extensions in strips and blocks, cut, separated, transversely shifted, and sheared.",
        "spatial design": "Bi-directional compression with longitudinal fissures and extensions, along with the harmonious half-enclosure shaped around the century-old camphor tree, reflects the museum's integration with the site's topography and runoff patterns.",
        "material design": "The museum uses reinforced concrete frames and locally cast-in-place reinforced concrete walls for structure, underhanging steel structures for bridges, and glass to protect and highlight the cracks in the building. It also utilizes local stone materials with a vertical coarse texture reminiscent of geological textures for its exterior.",
