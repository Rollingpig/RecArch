        "highlights": "Integration of the art gallery with the existing landscape and agricultural tradition, self-sustainable energy solutions, and minimal visual impact of the new building.",
        "shape": "The new building is a volume resulting from an incision in the ground, designed to camouflage with the landscape.",
        "spatial design": "The building's design making an incision into the landscape accentuates the preservation of the vineyard and allows the vines to envelop the structure.",
        "material design": "The use of exposed concrete which will integrate with the surrounding colors and textures over time, and the presence of skylights with photovoltaic panels.",

        "highlights": "The design appears to be efficient in its use of space, likely creating an effective flow throughout the rooms.",
        "shape": "The form of the design is modern and linear with well-defined spaces.",
        "spatial design": "The layout is highlighted by a clear division of rooms and a logical flow that could facilitate both privacy and accessibility.",

    "interior": {
        "highlights": "The gallery space is designed with a minimalist aesthetic that emphasizes the artwork on display. White walls, track lighting, and an open floor layout create a neutral environment that focuses the viewer's attention on the pieces of art rather than the architecture itself.",
        "shape": "The gallery utilizes a rectangular form with right angles creating a clean and uncluttered space. Cubic display plinths are used for presenting sculptures.",
        "spatial design": "The utilization of geometric shapes and forms along with adequate open space around artworks allows for easy circulation and unobstructed viewing. Skylights or ceiling cut-outs add interest and provide natural lighting.",
        "material design": "The materials appear to prioritize simplicity and functionality. The walls are likely finished with a matte paint, and the floors may be polished concrete or a similar material that complements the minimalistic approach. The transparent material of the display case housing the sculpture ensures visibility from multiple angles.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design includes its minimalist fa\u00e7ade with large glass panels for transparency and modern aesthetic, alongside a dynamic roof structure featuring asymmetrical skylights that appear to add an element of interest to the roofline.",
        "shape": "The design employs a mostly rectangular form with clean lines and a flat facade, complemented by angled elements in the roof which add an unexpected and modern twist.",
        "spatial design": "Its shape and form are characterized by openness and clarity, with a simple and functional layout that allows for natural light to penetrate the space through large windows and rooftop openings.",
        "material design": "The design showcases a contrast between the transparent glass elements and the more solid, possibly concrete or textured, wall to the right side of the image, giving it a mixed-material composition characteristic of contemporary architecture.",

        "shape": "The form is linear with angular variations in the roofline, creating an interesting silhouette.",
        "spatial design": "The multi-angle roof creates dynamic ceiling planes and contributes to a diverse volumetric experience within the building.",
        "material design": "There is a notable use of transparent materials for the skylights, juxtaposed with what appears to be solid wall materials, emphasizing the interplay of light and shadow in the interior spaces.",
