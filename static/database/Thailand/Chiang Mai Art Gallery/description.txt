An Art Collector's gallery in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand consisting of several interior pavilions enclosed by intricate gardens with exterior sculptures and ornate water features. Enter projects Asia was commissioned to design the display of bespoke artworks, using all-natural materials. The international collection of silverware, fine china, and porcelain includes the largest Wedgwood collection in Southeast Asia. The owner and avid collector sought to contextualize a lifelong ambition to exhibit the treasures gathered over a 50-year period. Traditionally a clinical space in which art objects meet an audience, Enter Projects Asia was challenged to bring life to the gallery, with zoning, lighting, and seating in their signature style blending 3D geometries with traditional Thai craftsmanship. "We sought to create an immersive experience, giving the space a warmth and depth uncharacteristic of conventional art galleries" states Patrick Keane, Enter Projects Asia Director.
