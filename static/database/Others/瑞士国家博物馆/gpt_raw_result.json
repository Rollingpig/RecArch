        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the combination of historical and modern architectural elements. The new building integrates environmental features directly into the architecture, including a bridge connecting the inner courtyard and the park, as well as a modern interpretation of materials matching the old museum.",
        "shape": "The form used is a contemporary design with expressive folded roofs and a combination of open and enclosed spaces between the old and the new buildings.",
        "spatial design": "The spatial design highlights are the coordination of the museum's layout with the surrounding trees and roads, the expansive spaces inside the museum, and the central theme of a bridge that spans across vast spaces.",
        "material design": "The highlight in spatial and material design is the use of textured concrete materials that echo the industrial nature of the interior spaces and the development of a new tuff concrete on the facade that is consistent with the limestone facade of the old building. Also noteworthy is the polished concrete floor inside, in contrast with the terrazzo floors of the old building.",

    "exterior": {
        "highlights": "The architectural design features a bold cantilevered section, creating a striking contrast with the surrounding traditional building facades.",
        "shape": "The design utilizes geometric forms with a prominent angled cantilever.",
        "spatial design": "The cantilevered shape creates a dynamic interaction between the new structure and the existing urban context. The geometry suggests both stability and a sense of movement.",
        "material design": "The use of uniform, raw concrete material highlights the minimalist and modern approach to the design, contrasting with the texture of the older stone building.",

    "floorplan": {
        "highlights": "The design integrates a traditional rectangular layout with a modern, angular extension, creating a dynamic juxtaposition.",
        "shape": "Combination of traditional rectilinear forms and an innovative angular, zigzagging extension.",
        "spatial design": "The interplay between old and new elements, where the angular extension connects and contrasts with the traditional layout.",
        "material design": "The plan doesn't specify materials, but the contrast in form suggests a careful selection of materials to complement the innovative design.",
        "keywords": "Dynamic, juxtaposition, rectilinear, angular, traditional meets modern, innovative, contrasting forms"
    },
    "interior": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its minimalistic approach with the use of concrete and the unique lighting installation on the ceiling that creates a dynamic pattern.",
        "shape": "The form utilized is mainly rectangular with a focus on long, straight lines and angles, emphasized by the geometrical lighting.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the sleek, unadorned surfaces that create a strong sense of depth and perspective, reinforced by the linear lighting above.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the exposed concrete on the walls and ceilings, giving a modern, industrial feel, paired with terrazzo flooring, which provides a polished finish.",

    },
    "section": {
        "highlights": "The design features a dynamic roofline that descends toward one end, providing a sense of movement and asymmetry.",
        "shape": "The structure uses geometric shapes, primarily rectangular forms that are connected by the sloping roof.",
        "spatial design": "The roof's slope creates interesting internal spaces, potentially allowing for high ceilings and multi-level floors within the building.",
        "material design": "While the materials are not specified, the prominence of clean lines suggests a minimalist material design that could be complemented by the use of glass, steel, or concrete.",
