        "highlights": "The design incorporates a mix of geometrical structures with a prominent dome, giving the complex an institutional and formal appearance.",
        "shape": "The design uses a combination of rectangular and cylindrical forms, with a central dome as a focal point.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the symmetrical layout that provides a sense of balance and order, with the dome providing a central anchor.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design seems to be the use of lighter and darker materials to define different sections and structures within the complex.",

    "facade": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its bold geometrical shapes and the way it plays with asymmetry while still appearing balanced.",
        "shape": "The form it uses is mainly angular with stark, clean lines and geometric shapes such as rectangles and triangles.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the manner in which the blocks and spaces interact to create a dynamic yet harmonious structure.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of uniform, light-colored stone that gives a minimalist yet textured appearance.",

    "floorplan": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design appears to be its symmetrical layout with a central circular feature, possibly an atrium or courtyard.",
        "shape": "The building uses a primarily rectangular form with extensions and a central circular shape which could be a dome or open space.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the central circular space that serves as a focal point, flanked symmetrically by rectangular wings on each side, providing a balanced design.",
        "material design": "As this is a floor plan, specific material designs cannot be determined, but the layout suggests a combination of open spaces and enclosed rooms for varied functionalities.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the integration of modern art installations within a large, naturally lit atrium space.",
        "shape": "The architecture employs a geometric form, with rectangular shapes predominating and clean, straight lines creating a sense of order and modernity.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the open atrium that enables an interplay of light and shadow, providing an open and airy atmosphere.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of glass for the ceiling to allow for abundant natural light and the use of stone or concrete for walls that give a sense of permanence and solidity.",
