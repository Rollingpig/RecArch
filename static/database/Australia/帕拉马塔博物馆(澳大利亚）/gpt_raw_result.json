        "highlights": "The Powerhouse Parramatta museum in Sydney is designed to reimagine the museum experience with a visitor-centric approach, featuring magnificent exhibition spaces with tactile materials, attention to detail, and a human scale.",
        "shape": "The architecture consists of two connected rectilinear volumes of varying heights.",
        "spatial design": "The museum encourages visitors to find their own way through the space rather than guiding them from one exhibit to the next, reflecting a visitor-focused design.",
        "material design": "The museum employs tactile materials to enhance the guest experience and maintains a human scale to ensure comfort and relatability.",

        "highlights": "The design features a distinctive building with a complex geometric facade, incorporating lush rooftop gardens and a mix of uses that appear to integrate communal outdoor spaces.",
        "shape": "The form includes irregular polygonal shapes and structures interconnected with each other, showcasing a modern and bold architectural style.",
        "spatial design": "The building's shape and form are highlighted by the intricate network of geometric patterns that create dynamic and visually captivating spaces.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the contrast between the transparency of extensive glass surfaces and the solid, white geometric frame that gives it a futuristic look.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the intricate network of geometric patterns forming a dynamic fa\u00e7ade.",
        "shape": "The form uses a combination of rectangular structures with a diagrid system.",
        "spatial design": "The emphasis on its shape and form is the diagrid structural system that creates open, transparent spaces at the building\u2019s base, while providing a sense of rhythm and texture.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design are the presumably metallic diagrid elements that contrast with the large expanses of glass and the solidity of the floors above.",

    "exterior": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design appears to be its intricate exoskeleton-like external structure which provides both aesthetic appeal and structural support.",
        "shape": "The building structure utilizes rectangular forms that stack and intersect in modern and clean lines, incorporating a large, visible X-bracing system.",
        "spatial design": "The use of the X-bracing not only presents a geometric feature on the exterior but likely influences the internal spatial organization, hinting at open floor plans within.",
        "material design": "The materials that stand out are the glass which allows for transparency and natural lighting and the metal or steel elements comprising the bracing, which create a modern and industrial feel.",
