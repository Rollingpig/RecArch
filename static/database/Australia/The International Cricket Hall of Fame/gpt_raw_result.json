        "shape": "The form uses a combination of angular geometry with clean lines and rectangular shapes.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the way the transparent glass areas interact with the solid, darker panels, possibly metal, which provides a contrast that defines different spaces within the building.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the juxtaposition of glass that allows visual permeability and the opaque vertical elements that provide solid anchoring to the structure.",

        "highlights": "The building features a prominent use of glass that provides transparency and reflects the environment, creating a dialogue between the structure and its surroundings.",
        "shape": "The architecture presents a modern, boxy form with strong geometric lines and varied elevations.",
        "spatial design": "The integration of glass and solid panels in the facade highlights its shape and form, offering both open and enclosed spaces.",
        "material design": "The contrast between the transparency of the glass and the solidity of the darker metallic or composite panels gives the building a distinctive textural quality.",
