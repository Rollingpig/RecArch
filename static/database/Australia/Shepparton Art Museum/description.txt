The design of SAM is characterised by simplicity and clarity, with compelling imagery creating a landmark cultural destination for Shepparton. It is located on the approach to the town centre, within a popular park within the flat Goulburn River Plain. The scheme was won in a limited competition. It includes an art museum, Visitorsâ€™ Information Centre, Kaiela Arts Aboriginal Community Arts Centre and a 150 person event space able to operate out of hours for conferences, weddings and social occasions, all within a 5,000m2 cubic form.

A restricted ground floor, required due to a floodway across the site, was turned into a design opportunity. The small footprint was extruded vertically over five levels to generate the distinctive small-and-tall art museum. This strategy maximises much-used park space, while also creating a beacon in the low, flat Shepparton landscape. The height also affords panoramic views from the rooftop events space across the lake and Goulburn Red River Gum Reserve beyond.
