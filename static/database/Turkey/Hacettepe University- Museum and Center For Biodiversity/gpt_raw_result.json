        "highlights": "The Museum and Center for Biodiversity serves as both a contribution to landscape preservation and a social stimulus for the scientific community on Hacettepe University's Beytepe Campus.",
        "shape": "The text does not provide specific information regarding the shape of the building.",
        "spatial design": "The spatial design seems to be a reflection of the biodiversity theme, with interconnected valleys and ridges, however, the text does not specify details about the building's shape and form.",
        "material design": "The text does not mention specific materials used, but implies a design that integrates into the natural surroundings and preserves distinct ecosystems.",

    "birdview": {
        "highlights": "The building features a prominent flat rooftop and large geometric sections that create a sense of bold modernity amidst a snowy landscape.",
        "shape": "The architecture exhibits a mixture of boxy, geometric forms with flat rooflines.",
        "spatial design": "The design highlights straight lines and rectangular forms that create a structured and ordered appearance.",
        "material design": "It appears to use materials that allow for large, flat surfaces and sharp edges, possibly concrete or a similar composite for the walls, with extensive use of glass for windows.",

    "facade": {
        "highlights": "The design incorporates a juxtaposition of translucent glass panels with solid, opaque cladding, providing a striking contrast between elements that appear light and heavy.",
        "shape": "The building showcases rectangular and stacked forms, with cantilevered sections creating an impression of suspended volumes.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the interplay of suspended volumes that seem to defy gravity, giving the structure a dynamic and modern aesthetic.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of a translucent glass facade which likely allows natural light to permeate the interior spaces while the opaque cladding contrasts with a grounding effect.",

    "floorplan": {
        "highlights": "The design integrates hexagonal and orthogonal elements, creating a unique contrast between nature-inspired geometry and traditional architectural forms.",
        "shape": "The design prominently features hexagonal shapes that are connected and interspersed with rectangular blocks. There's also a consideration of flow and open spaces, which is shaped by these geometries.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the innovative combination of hexagonal modules, which may suggest an approach for flexibility or expansion, along with the rectangular sections that provide a sense of stability and traditional space division.",
        "material design": "The material design cannot be determined from this image alone, which is a black and white floor plan. However, the emphasis seems to be on creating a variety of interconnected spaces, which would likely influence material choices to maintain design consistency or highlight different zones.",

    "interior": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design includes the innovative use of natural lighting, the geometric play of the ceiling fixtures, and the harmonious blend of different materials and textures that create a modern and inviting space.",
        "shape": "The form used in this design is a combination of linear shapes and clean lines that complement the rectangular and angled forms present throughout the interior.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the interplay of light and shadow cast by the strategically placed ceiling lights which create a pattern that adds depth and dimension to the space.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of both natural and synthetic materials. The light wooden panels and the use of glass contrast with the smooth, painted surfaces and the metal elements, integrating warmth and sophistication.",
