        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the physical connection between otherwise insulated lakes, and the aim to foster social interaction and gatherings in public spaces.",
        "shape": "The project is defined by a massive central cantilever structure.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the horizontal extension that encourages societal interaction and gatherings throughout the building, with a great hall underneath for proximity to nature.",
        "material design": "The spatial design is notable for the building's part that brings out the landscape and connection to nature, even without specific celebratory events. It is integrated with natural surroundings and suspended over the water surface, inviting visitors to wander within the landscape.",

    "detail": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its perforated exterior which gives the building a lightweight, semi-transparent appearance.",
        "shape": "The form appears to be a modern, linear geometry with sharp, clean lines and a mostly rectangular shape.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the way it balances opacity and transparency, creating dynamic visual effects and allowing for natural lighting within.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of the perforated metal skin which interacts with light and shadow, creating a visually interesting facade while also functioning as an environmental filter.",

    "exterior": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the large, singular pylon rising vertically, from which multiple cables span out to support the structure. The interaction of the building with the water, featuring a fountain, is also notable.",
        "shape": "The building has a modern and geometrical silhouette with an emphasis on clean rectangular shapes. It utilizes asymmetry in the arrangement of its support structures and the pylon.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the harmonious blend of linear, geometric aspects with the organic form of the surrounding water, creating a sense of balance and innovative spatial integration.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the use of what appears to be concrete for the main structural components, alongside the incorporation of steel cables offering tensile support, echoing elements of both brutalism and modern material technology.",

    "exterior2": {
        "highlights": "The design features a suspended structure that seemingly floats above the landscape, supported by a single, prominent concrete pillar and a series of tension cables.",
        "shape": "The form is rectangular and geometric, with clean lines and an overall minimalist aesthetic. It is a combination of a suspended box-shaped structure anchored by a tall vertical element.",
        "spatial design": "The use of suspended construction creates a sense of lightness and allows for an unobstructed space beneath the main structure, integrating the building with its surroundings.",
        "material design": "The highlight in spatial and material design is the contrast between the heaviness of the concrete pillar and the apparent weightlessness of the suspended structure, along with the transparency and reflection quality of the surrounding water body.",

    "interior": {
        "highlights": "The utilitarian elegance, with a focus on structural elements and minimalistic approach",
        "shape": "Rectilinear and functional form",
        "spatial design": "The open and airy space created by the use of an uncluttered design and the white color palette which enhances the sense of spaciousness",
        "material design": "Industrial materials, such as concrete floors, metal beams, and expanded metal mesh, which are left exposed to highlight their intrinsic beauty",
