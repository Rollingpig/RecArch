The Geology Museum in Progreso, Yucatan is not just an ordinary museum; it’s a fusion of culture and public space, all designed as a cohesive unit. Located along the coast and close to the customs dock of Progreso, the museum is a collection of volumes, each with different heights, arranged in an organized grid. These volumes function individually and together, creating inviting spaces within them, shaded areas for relaxation, and a stunning landscaped roof that spans diagonally from corner to corner above the museum spaces.
