        "highlights": "The museum is a fusion of culture and public space designed as a cohesive unit, with individual and connected volumes creating inviting spaces and a landscaped roof.",
        "shape": "The museum consists of a collection of volumes with different heights arranged in an organized grid.",
        "spatial design": "It emphasizes the configuration of individual yet interconnected volumes to create inviting spaces and shaded areas, along with an impressive diagonal landscaped roof.",

        "highlights": "The building's integration with the shoreline environment and its modern, grid-like modular facade.",
        "shape": "The building is rectangular and modular with a flat roof design.",
        "spatial design": "The alignment of square and rectangular modules creates a harmonious geometric pattern. It incorporates greenery in terraces and balconies, enhancing its appeal.",
        "material design": "The use of glass and concrete materials stands out, with the glass allowing for natural light penetration and sea views, and the concrete providing a sleek, modern finish.",

    "facade": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is its modern take on geometric forms, with an emphasis on angular cuts and recessed entry points that create a rhythmic pattern.",
        "shape": "The form it uses is geometric and angular with an emphasis on triangular motifs in the negative space of the fa\u00e7ades.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the repetition of crisp geometric lines and angular shapes, which provide a visually interesting fa\u00e7ade and play with light and shadow.",
        "material design": "The highlight in its spatial and material design is the consistent use of a smooth, light-colored finish that enhances the geometry and provides a stark contrast to the vibrant sky and natural surroundings.",

    "flooplan": {
        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the structured layout with various enclosed spaces and open areas that suggest a balance of privacy and communal interaction.",
        "shape": "The form primarily uses geometric shapes with a mix of square and rectangular modules which are repeated throughout the design to create a cohesive pattern.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the central rectangular courtyard space, which provides a focal point and a potential light well for the surrounding rooms.",
        "material design": "The material design is not explicitly detailed in this image, but the contrast in the shading suggests a play between solid and void, possibly indicating material variance or the inclusion of green spaces.",

        "highlights": "The highlight of this design is the symmetrical triangular framing leading towards a view of palm trees and a water feature.",
        "shape": "The form uses a series of repeating triangular shapes, creating a tunnel-like effect.",
        "spatial design": "The highlight of its shape and form is the use of repetition and perspective, guiding the viewer's eye towards the central vanishing point framed by the triangular archways.",
        "material design": "The design uses clean, smooth surfaces, likely concrete, with minimal ornamentation to emphasize the geometric shapes and play of light and shadow.",
